# Assignment: Stock Trend Prediction

We are going to use data from 30 consecutive days stock data to predict the stock closing price trend after 1 day, 5 days, and 10 days. 

To do this assignment, I write my code on a notebook that can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or other IDE. 
I used Python 3.14 and differents libraries like torch for my neural network and SVM model.

To make sure that the code will run properly, it is needed to ensure that the stock data is in the correct format (.csv) and that the required libraries are installed.
Then, run all the cells of this notebook to get the predictions asked.
